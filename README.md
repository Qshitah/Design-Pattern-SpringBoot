Design Patterns in Spring Boot: Employee and Department Management
This project demonstrates the implementation of Design Patterns in a Spring Boot application, focusing on the Builder and Specification patterns. It includes a well-structured employee and department management system integrated with JUnit and Mockito for testing.

Features
Entity Design with Builder Pattern:

Simplifies object creation for Employee and Department entities.
Encapsulates complex construction logic in an easy-to-use builder class.
Flexible Queries with Specification Pattern:

Allows dynamic and reusable query filters for employees based on:
Name
Email
Department
Ensures clean separation of concerns for query logic.
CRUD Operations:

Full CRUD functionality for managing Employee and Department entities.
Testing:

Unit tests for services using JUnit.
Mocking with Mockito to isolate and validate business logic.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For rapid development and dependency injection.
Hibernate/JPA: For ORM and database interactions.
Builder Pattern: To simplify object construction.
Specification Pattern: For reusable and flexible query logic.
JUnit & Mockito: For testing services and components.
